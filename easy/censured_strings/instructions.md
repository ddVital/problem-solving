### C\*ns\*r\*d Str\*ngs
Someone has attempted to censor my strings by replacing every vowel with a `*`, `l*k* th*s`. Luckily, I've been able to find the vowels that were removed.

Given a censored string and a string of the censored vowels, return the original uncensored string.

#### Example
```
uncensor("Wh*r* d*d my v*w*ls g*?", "eeioeo") ➞ "Where did my vowels go?"

uncensor("abcd", "") ➞ "abcd"

uncensor("*PP*RC*S*", "UEAE") ➞ "UPPERCASE"
```
